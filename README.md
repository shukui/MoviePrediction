# Movie Gross Prediction
This project is a machine learning model that predicts the gross income of a movie based on its **budget, IMDB score, and Facebook likes**.   
It uses a linear regression to fit the data.

The original dataset has 28 features, but this project only uses 4 of them: budget, imdb_score, movie_facebook_likes, and gross.   
The dataset is stored in a CSV file named **movie_metadata.csv**.
